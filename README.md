# Text-Classification
Use scikit learn to implement text classifiers for sentiment analysis.
You	are	given	the	following		customer	reviews	dataset:	CR.zip, which	includes	
positive	and	negative	reviews.	CR	is	a	small	dataset	that	doesnâ€™t	have	train/test	
divisions,	so	you	are	required	to	evaluate	the	performance	using	10-fold	crossvalidation.
